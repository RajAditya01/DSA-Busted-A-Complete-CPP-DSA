// Encapsulation is the packing of "data" and "functions operating on that data" into a single component
// and restricting the access to some of the object's components.

// Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object's definition.

// Abstraction is a mechanism which represent the essential features without including implementation details.

// Encapsulation:-- Information hiding.
// Abstraction:-- Implementation hiding.
